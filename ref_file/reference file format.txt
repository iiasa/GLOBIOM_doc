The reference file consists of two sections: The information about the code
compiled and the information about the symbols in the GAMS program
(aka symbol table). The information about the code compiled consists of
records with 11 fields. The meaning of the fields is:

- record count
- symbol index
- symbol name
- symbol type
- reference type (available: declared, defined, impl-asn, assigned, ref, control)
- global listing line
- local line
- local column position (due to macros this many not be always 100% correct)
- include nesting level
- index in the file summary
- file name

The symbol table starts with the line that is indicated by a 0 in the first
field, followed by the number of records in this symbol table and the text
"size of symboltable". The records for the symbol table consists of:

- internal symbol index
- symbol name
- numerical and string symbol type
- dimension (0 for functions and models)
- cardinality (0 for functions, card(sym) for regular symbols, and number
  of equation symbols for models) 
- a list of length dimension with the internal symbol index of the domain
  set (0 if universe)
- the symbol text
