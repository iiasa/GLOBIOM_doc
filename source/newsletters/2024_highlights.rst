| **Holistic food system innovation strategies can close up to 80% of China’s domestic protein gaps while reducing global environmental impacts**
| Zhao, H., Fan, X., Bai, Z. et al. analyze food system innovation to reduce protein import dependency in China while promoting global environmental sustainability. This research was published in Nature Food.
| **DOI:** `10.1038/s43016-024-01011-z  <https://doi.org/10.1038/s43016-024-01011-z>`_

Policy contributions and community engagement
---------------------------------------------

| **Supporting Ambitious EU Climate Goals**

**Marta Kozicka** was named `Austria's 2024 National Champion <https://iiasa.ac.at/news/apr-2024/marta-kozicka-is-national-champion-for-austria-in-prestigious-frontiers-planet-prize>`_ in the prestigious Frontiers Planet Prize for her groundbreaking study using GLOBIOM to examine the potential of plant-based dietary transitions to achieve sustainability goals. Her research, conducted with a multidisciplinary team, explored how adopting plant-based meat and milk alternatives can contribute to climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation.

**Petr Havlík**, leader of the IBF group and BNR program, was recognized as a `2024 Highly Cited Researcher by Clarivate <https://iiasa.ac.at/news/nov-2024/iiasa-researchers-recognized-on-clarivates-2024-highly-cited-researcherstm-list>`_, highlighting his significant contributions to environment, ecology, and social sciences research. Notably, Havlík is among the select group of 216 researchers worldwide honored in two fields this year.

Looking ahead
-------------

**Updated GLOBIOM Documentation:** We are working on an update of the `2023 GLOBIOM documentation <https://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/18996/1/GLOBIOM_Documentation.pdf>`_ to reflect recent model developments and applications. This should be finalized in the first half of 2025.

**LAMASUS Summer School 2025:** Planning is underway for the 2025 edition of the LAMASUS Summer School from 2-6th June, which will offer training on land-use and sustainability modeling. Further details, including dates and application procedures, can be accessed here.

**YSSP 2025:** In June 2025, the GLOBIOM team will welcome three researchers for a three-month research stay as part of the **Young Scientists Summer Program** (YSSP). The `YSSP program <https://iiasa.ac.at/early-career/yssp>`_ offers PhD students an opportunity to advance their research in an international and interdisciplinary setting at IIASA, working closely with experienced scientists on global sustainability challenges. Applications for the YSSP 2026 cohort will open in fall 2025.
