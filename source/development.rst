Development
===========
The `GLOBIOM wiki <https://github.com/iiasa/GLOBIOM/wiki>`_ provides background and guidelines
for GLOBIOM development with an IIASA-specific focus. The GitHub `issue tracker
<https://github.com/iiasa/GLOBIOM/issues>`_ and `project boards
<https://github.com/iiasa/GLOBIOM/projects>`_ support collaborative development for team
members. These links work if you are signed in to GitHub and are a member of the
``iiasa/GLOBIOM`` GitHub team, or have been given collaborator access.
