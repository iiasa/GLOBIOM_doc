Development
===========
GLOBIOM is mostly comprised of GAMS code and some R code. Prospective collaborating researchers can contact the IIASA GLOBIOM team by sending an email to ``globiom.support@iiasa.ac.at``. Please mention your affiliation, research background, GitHub username, and the reason for your interest in collaborating on GLOBIOM. When a collaboration is agreed on, access will be provided to GLOBIOM source code and data repositories.

The `GLOBIOM wiki <https://github.com/iiasa/GLOBIOM/wiki>`_ provides background and guidelines for GLOBIOM development with an IIASA-specific focus. The GitHub `issue tracker <https://github.com/iiasa/GLOBIOM/issues>`_ and `project boards <https://github.com/iiasa/GLOBIOM/projects>`_ support collaborative development for team members. These links work if you are signed in to GitHub and are a member of the ``iiasa/GLOBIOM`` GitHub team, or have been given collaborator access.

Lastly, you can subscribe to the `GLOBIOM mailing list <https://lists.globiom.org/mailman/listinfo/globiom-l>`_ to receive community announcements such as job openings. Subscriptions are subject to approval and intended for established members of the GLOBIOM community.
